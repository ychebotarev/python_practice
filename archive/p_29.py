What is the best algorithm to find the minimum cost for joining a set of rods to produce one rod,
where in a single move you can join any two rods with cost of this operation equal to the length of the new rod?

Example:
Suppose the rod lengths are { 1,2,3 }
Then optimal way would be:
1) merge 1 and 2 => {3,3} cost = 3
2) merge 3 and 3 => {6} cost = 6
Total cost =
